so In the guidance of Harris bhaiya , I tried my best completing the work alloted to me . in the process i learned ML from the very basics 
linear reg
multiple linear reg
logistic reg
GAN
style GANs
i didnt explore the cycle GAN part But bhaiya mentioned that too in his resources 

while i was working , i had faces a lot of problems with connecting my GPU for fast processing , harris bhaiya guided me well here . His experence in coding helped me a lot.
